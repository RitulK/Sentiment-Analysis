**NLP Sentiment Analysis**

This project, developed as part of an IBM course, leverages the Embeddable Watson AI Library to analyze sentiment in text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project categorizes user-generated text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories.

**Project Overview**

The NLP sentiment analysis project utilizes various NLP techniques to preprocess and classify sentiment in text data. This analysis can be applied to customer feedback, social media monitoring, and brand reputation management.

**Features**

Data Preprocessing: Text cleaning and preparation for analysis, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.

Sentiment Classification: Uses the Embeddable Watson AI Library for accurate sentiment classification.

Performance Evaluation: Evaluates model accuracy and other metrics to optimize sentiment detection.
